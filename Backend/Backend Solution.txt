#Backend Solution
To think up of a solution, we should consider the components that goes into this.
From the problem brief, each USER should be able to look at a MENU to order food.
Then, they can track their ORDER, and the order's receipt must be availble to view for 1 year.

Components
1. user
2. menu
    2.1 foods on the menu
3. receipt -> contains food
           -> relate to user

API functions:
    Allow the user to create accounts, storing their name and id in the database.
    The user can then call for items on the menu and choose. Users can then create 
    user specific orders, that is then stored on two endpoints. The order starts with state "delivering".
    In this case, they are also stored as a trackable order from their user id. 
    If the food is delivered, it is deleted and solely stored on another endpoint.

API endpoints:

POST /users
    create user during registration

GET /users/{id}
    get user info

POST /users/{id}/orders
    create an order from the user

GET /users/{id}/track
    get orders that can be tracked

GET /users/{id}/orders
    get all orders from user, might manage to delete them after a year.

POST /menu
    add to the menu

GET /menu
    get items on the menu
