The  main problem that comes with changing resolutions is the styled elements on the webpage
might not fit well within a smaller window like a phone. Furthermore, certain elements cannot
be displayed aesthetically while remaining functional. This calls for the webpage to be responsive
to the view window, adjusting its content according to the user's condition.

Main fixes that can be done:
1. Change the CSS of certain HTML DOM placements and size to be relative to the view window
2. Alter the navigation bar, appointing a minimum width where it changes to a hamburger menu to keep accessibility
3. Hiding certain contents that might clutter the phone webpage.
